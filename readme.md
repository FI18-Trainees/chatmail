## ChatMail
School project by @zaanposni and @monkmitrad
 
### Requirements

- The user should be able to select the recipient from a combo box or list box 
- The prototype must only be able to send a message to a recipient (FISI). However, the database should be designed in such a way that it can theoretically also store a message intended for several recipients 
- Own messages are updated every 5 seconds and displayed as text 
- It is not necessary to implement a user administration with password.
